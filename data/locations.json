Each“leaf” encases a corrugated steel tube filled with steel balls that rattle in the wind. The artist team calibrated the poles’ hinges to sway in a heavy gust of wind. Like seeds using the wind, these pods chime with the movement of the stalks.  Each stalk is anticipated to be made out of stainless steel segments, joined with pivots, and narrowing in diameter as they ascend in height up to 20-feet. The sound they make will be subtle and localized, like the sound of wind over grasslands.  The installation is in conjunction with the eco- friendly building for the Iowa Utilities Board and the attorney general’s Office of Consumer Advocate, near the State Capitol. It will remind people of the new wind turbine that will power the building from its spot just down the hill. The sculpture was funded by the Art in State Buildings Program, which requires a percentage of each new building fund to be spent on site- specific artwork. [u'', u'Steel'] art",

Mark Kane, former Garden Editor of Better Homes and Gardens and Ingersoll neighbor, explained, “Here’s the story. A group of neighbors came together and converted the traffic circle at 44th and Harwood into a garden. Today it looks great and serves to inspire other neighborhood associations.” In late summer 2011, Kane proposed that his neighborhood “add art to the garden and went to the Greater Des Moines Public Art Foundation to proposed the idea.” Once the Public Art Foundation approved the design project, it then advanced the process by securing permission from Des Moines Water Works to wrap the design around its telemetry box located on the traffic circle. Neighborhood funds were leveraged, graphic design services donated, and Beeline+Blue, the company which printed and installed the dramatic images, made a contribution. The neighborhood and Water Works were impressed. “Today, the utility box signals to drivers, joggers, walkers, everyone who passes, that the circle is a special place, slow down, take a look,” boasted Kane. The Ingersoll Neighborhood utility box is the second box to be wrapped in Des Moines, the prototype was completed in March 2011 at Polk Boulevard and University Avenue.

Iowa’s intense summer heat—magnified by the glass blocks and exacerbated by the trapped moisture—caused the light supports to fail. As a result, the neon lights within the sculpture fell to the bottom and shattered. \n\nThe artist restored the sculpture’s original luminescence, albeit with an updated creative vision. The light sculpture’s repair and restoration was paid with private dollars from the Herrick Trust, a private contribution that fueled the fundraising campaign for construction of the State Historical Building.

Today, this location is known as Principal Park.\n\nMore than 500 pieces of tile form the mosaic mural, which depicts American Indian life, the first white settler, various symbols and the future. The theme of the mural spans native American history and the highways and bridges of today; the wild rose and oak leaves are both Iowa symbols. \n\nThe area is near where Captain James Allen and 50 other soldiers pulled ashore on May 20, 1843, to begin building a fort. The fort was built to control the Sauk and Meskwaki Indians, who had been transplanted to the area from their traditional lands in eastern Iowa. Fort Des Moines was a small collection of log buildings, most of which were replaced soon after the city of Des Moines was established in 1846. [u'Mural', u'Ceramic'] art",

The “Gymnast“ series of sculpture captures the basic strength of a bending and stretching athlete, rather than with the kind of virtuosity that brings an Olympic audience to its feet. Limbering up, not performing, is its subject matter. \n\nThe figure is highly simplified. Although neither head, nor arms nor feet are described, the viewer can decipher a tautened form. More important is the fact that the summary bending or lifting defines itself as a sustained effort. This gymnast is not fooling around, and the areas of maximum tension are so well conveyed as to make a sedentary observer wince.\n\nTucker has called his earlier work a “prolonged anatomy lesson“ in construction, but this terminology applies just as well to the late work. His sculpture has always been concerned with an apparent loss of overarching structure. He pares away at forms, but instead of finding a complete skeleton with a complementary network of attached muscles and veins, as it were, he discovers a succession of disparate jointed sections whose position in the greater scheme of things is unclear. To use an archaeological metaphor: It is as though, having investigated the site of a lost city, one were to discover plenty of hinges but no doors or walls. [u'Outdoor Sculpture', u'Bronze'] art",

    "search_text" : "A Social History of Des Moines  Des Moines  Historian and author Gregg R. Narber Ph.D. wrote in 1982: “The Children’s Reading Room was decorated under the WPA in true fresco on all its walls and pillars with a mural style called by its designer, Harry Donald Jones, A Social History of Des Moines. Des Moines writer Henry Felsen prepared a written guide to the mural and its symbols which can only be summarized here.  The Social History begins with the spiral nebula theory of the creation of the earth, proceeds through cave men and the beasts which roamed Iowa in the glacial era, and then devotes considerable space to Iowa’s Indian past, with symbols of Sac and Fox legends.  An Indian trapper represents the fur trade in which valuable furs were traded ‘for such useless articles as outlandish, impractical clothing, green umbrellas, and great quantities of cheap, glittering beads and small mirrors.  Often [the Indian] was befuddled with liquor, so he might be more easily cheated.’ The Louisiana Purchase [1803-04] is represented by [President Thomas] Jefferson dropping coins into Napoleon [Bonaparte]’s hand. The corn at Jefferson’s feet represents ‘a harvest of peace;’ Napoleon stands on graves representing the futility of war.  Both hold steel, Jefferson a sickle curved and useful in cultivation; Napoleon a sword, straight and useful only in war.  The same event portrayed in the Knoxville Section mural is portrayed here in its brutal aspect -- the 1845 entry of white settlers to claim land in western Iowa. Wick-i-ups are torched, a pregnant squaw and her husband are forced at gunpoint from the land in which their ancestors are buried.  Objects in a fireplace in a following panel symbolize the transition in values ‘from ...protecting and building one’s own home by his own hand; to one of protecting and building one’s own home from one’s monetary accumulation;’ the scene symbolizes the growth of customs ‘less rural and more urban.’ Another wall contrasts Des Moines’ treatment of Kelley’s Army of 1,400 job-seekers marching to Washington, D.C., with that of Omaha: Des Moines fed the unemployed and built rafts to float them down river; Omaha forced their evacuation.  A Large section in the next panel shows a family turning from social disorder to order (especially a New Deal order), from chaos to security. For chaos a man in an ivory tower is shown who is blind to conditions around him and hands clasp the banner of lip service (symbolized rater literally), while a pile of gold with a mask of falsity and a valentine heart symbolize a Biblical truth: ‘The love of money is the root of all evil.’ Planes soar for war, smokestacks stand idle, figures whisper to symbolize ‘power behind the scenes,’ the secret deal, etc.  The family turns from these bad social conditions to a bright world brought about by engaged, interested planners.  Other symbols of social order are found in an elderly man receiving a Social Security check  and a building designed by Le Corbusier 'for use rather than ‘in the style of’.’ The mural is, in summary, an elaborate index of ideas and as such an important social document, quite apart from its considerable merits as a mural.  With the destruction of the Cedar Rapids TRAP mural, it is quite without comparison in Iowa.”\n [u'Mural', u' Site-specific', u'Fresco'] art",

Dr. Borlaug was an agronomist, humanitarian, father of the Green Revolution and founder of The World Food Prize. In 1970 Norman E. Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for a lifetime of work to feed a hungry world. Although a scientist with outstanding contributions, perhaps Dr. Borlaug's greatest achievement was his unending struggle to integrate the various streams of agricultural research into viable technologies and to persuade political leaders to bring these advances to fruition.\n\nDr. Borlaug received his Ph.D. in plant pathology and genetics from the University of Minnesota in 1942. He led the introduction of high-yielding wheat varieties and production techniques in Mexico, Pakistan, and India. He developed disease-resistant varieties of wheat that produced much more grain than traditional strains. “Norman E. Borlaug saved more lives than any man in human history,“ said Josette Sheeran, executive director of the U.N. World Food Program. “His heart was as big as his brilliant mind, but it was his passion and compassion that moved the world.“  He remained active well into his 90s, campaigning for the use of biotechnology to fight hunger.

    "search_text" : "Five Stones, One Tree  Des Moines  Four towering, grey limestone blocks stand on this site: two rough-cut pillars, each comprised of two stones, were erected so that their extreme edges are about 22-feet apart. The four mammoth stones are paired so that their smoothly textured (opposite) sides face east\/west and their adjacent surfaces that bulge with weathered, geological accretions face north\/south.\n\nThe fifth stone cube, a 16-ton block of ‘choice’ limestone in the assembly was buried six-feet underground between the two visible stone pillars.  “I liked the stone a lot; my favorite stone,” mused Utterback about this enigmatic, hidden object.  The spot of the elusive stone has left the once-level soil slightly settled.\n\nEuclidean geometry describes the space occupied by this inventive work of art, and demands true insight into the subject. The two stone pillars and the tree are organized as points of an isosceles triangle. A ginkgo tree is positioned at the northwest point of a triangle, and charts an imaginary line that runs from the entrance of the Hoover Building to the central dome of the State Capitol building.\n\nThe artist's choice of five stones was purposeful. The number “5” has a deep collection of meanings in math, science, religion and culture. In mathematics, “5” is the fifth Fibonacci number -- this numbering system is measurable everywhere in Nature from the reproduction of rabbits to patterns of pinecones.  Its sequence of numbers mirrors the growth of every living thing, including a single cell, a grain of wheat, a hive of bees, and mankind.\n\nHis selection of limestone is evocative. This sedimentary rock of organic origin which often yields a fossil treasure trove, was the building block used for the ancient Egyptian pyramids. Limestone exists deep beneath soil throughout the midwest, and was selected from Reed Quarries in Bloomington, IN. Limestone is a major player in Iowa's geologic history that goes back almost three billion years. \n\nThe Japanese ginkgo tree, known for its heartiness and longevity, was planted in 1980 and completed the piece. The ginkgo is a deep-rooted, large tree that produces a rough trunk bark and spreading, knobby branches with unique, fan-shaped leaves. Called a “living fossil,” the ginkgo tree species, through fossil records, dates back millions of years to prehistoric times. The ginkgo tree symbolizes hope and peace: four gingko trees in Hiroshima, Japan survived the 1945 atomic bomb blast and continue to thrive.\n\n“Five Stones, One Tree,“ a seminal work of art by the artist, aptly extracts the evolutionary cycle of growth and decay in nature – the essence of being.

For his controversial “Monument to Balzac“ (1891-98), Rodin made a study of the garment by draping it over a statue and daubing it with plaster to obtain the desired form. Rodin's garment embodies a missing silhouette, incarnating the novelist Balzac's strength and creative genius. Rodin's dressing gown also alludes to one of the myths surrounding Balzac's life: wakened in the night by sudden inspiration, the writer is said to have hastily thrown it on. [u'', u'Bronze'] art",

A design team comprised of Ken Smith, a highly-regarded landscape architect from the Des Moines area with offices in New York City and Los Angeles, and Jim Campbell, an artist from San Francisco whose works include highly interactive installations and various forms of electronic media. Themes emerged: make it a space for all ages, create a draw, a destination, and a postcard view for Des Moines, continue to incorporate water, support outdoor community gatherings, and design the plaza with a balance of green and paved spaces. \n\nBACKGROUND: The plaza was dedicated in the 1979 as part of the new Civic Center Complex which replaced the recently closed KRNT Theater.  The area was named after Gerald and Henry Nollen in recognition of their contributions to Des Moines commerce and culture; both were officers of Bankers Trust, which has become Principal Financial, and active in a number of civic organizations.\n\nCowles Commons is a block square park containing a tree-lined grassy area on its Walnut Street frontage and the Brenton Waterfall and Reflecting Pool with surrounding steps that provide audience-seating along Locust and 3rd Streets.  “Crusoe Umbrella,“ a sculpture by Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen, stands on the northeast corner of the Plaza.

    "search_text" : "Slides  Ankeny  The painted and fused glass installation called “Slides” is integrated into the Laboratory’s visitor entrance. It is arranged within a triangular-shaped atrium.  The exterior glass walls are faced with either a grid or row of glass sheets imprinted with a countryside vista or detail. There are four layers of translucent panels positioned in front of each scene of nature. This system was devised to offer opportunities to glide the panels along recessed-tracks and configure new relationships.  Accordingly these lavishly colorful compositions can be overlapped or isolated. \n\nThe Iowa Laboratory Facility is a place where four state agencies maintain five laboratories: (1) Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation (a.k.a. DCI), Criminalistics Laboratory, Iowa Department of Public Safety; (2) Office of the State Medical Examiner, Iowa Department of Public Health; (3) University of Iowa Hygienic Laboratory; and (4) Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship metrology and agriculture labs. \n\nSato juxtaposed Iowa's natural environment with the technology, evidence, and other images linked to laboratory work. Her witty assemblage offers an inexhaustible archive of analytical data. It is an object lesson in observation: A drying rack for test tubes, a centrifuge, “save-jars” with labels reading ‘State Medical Examiner’, a tray filled with autopsy instruments (tweezers, scissors, T-bar, and scalpel), blood splatters, X-rays, microscopic cells, graduated cylinders, bullets, and brain-tissue are presented as visually poignant, sometimes unnerving objects. \n \nThe angled north wall opposite the entrance holds the largest section. Four movable “slides” are layered against a grid of 12 stationary glass panels. The grid depicts rolling farm fields photographed on a snow-covered winter day. Lightly screened on one of the “slides” are two long chains of nucleotides twisted into a double helix. Interests of the metrology and agricultural labs are featured in a flanking “slide”.  Two ears of corn are separated by a seismograph drawing with characteristic up-and-down waves measuring ground motion beneath Iowa’s surface. Close-up details of corn is emblematic of the fruits of labor.\n\nA more somber “slide” relates to death investigations. A faded slice of twisted rope dangles behind a pair of “open” autopsy scissors which are boldly sandblasted into the surface.  Evidence includes a blood-red smear swabbed over the lower portion of the panel.\n \nWater quality is the subject of the fourth “slide.” Bathed with greenish-blue color, the panel portrays animal and plant organisms and the indigenous Black Crappie swimming into and out of this composition. In the center is a range map for fish species of Iowa.\n\nAlong the opposite wall are 12 additional movable “slides” with landscape backdrops. In one of the “slides,” vapors rise from a crimson chemistry beaker. There is a metamorphous of the hard-edge, iconic chemistry beaker into soft-focus, idyllic baby toes – the sole figurative element in the artwork. Prenatal and neonatal research is captured in a neighboring “slide,” too.  Rich yellow pigment is spread over the surface in a painterly fashion. It is embellished with repeated patterns of red blobs intended as a blood test.\n\nThere is a lyrical quality in Sato’s study of insects. The pesky gypsy moth, a speckled-colored corn rootworm, an iridescent copper and green Japanese beetle, and a ground beetle are portrayed with spontaneous movement and a frugal use of detail. In the agricultural lab, these insects become specimen samplings for crop and foliage infestations. \n\nA “lifted” fingerprint is enhanced on a pale-blue “slide.” Russet-colored ridges of the fingerprint contain abstractly coded lines of letters and numbers – for the crime lab.  Dangling in the panel’s upper left corner is a dusting brush coated with power on its soft rounded bristles – a tool used to reveal this hidden information. [u'', u'Glass'] art",

Introducing metallic casts of this ancient tree to Des Moines’ downtown, typically defined by man-made structures of glass and concrete, the artist furthers his investigation of themes of time and displacement, and the relationship between natural and artificial environments.

During the closing of the Musée Picasso from March 2006 to July 2008, the deputy mayor of Antibes requested an outdoor project from curator Jean-Louis Andral. One of his leads was Plensa, as Andral was familiar with his monumental work in several metropolises throughout the world. The artist was charmed, and in a stroke of luck he had a sculpture in production for the Art Basel fair in Miami.\n\nIt was an instantaneous and almost magical alchemy that occurred between the Nomade and the newly restored Saint-Jaume bastion. It was a meeting between a place and a work of art. “Nomade“ was celebrated by thousands of visitors seduced by the presence of this monumental statue, sitting on the city ramparts, its imaginary gaze locked into the vastness of the Mediterranean Sea. Subsequently, this sculpture left for Miami and was acquired by art collectors Mary and John Pappajohn of Des Moines.\n\nThe city of Antibes Juan-les-Pins ordered a similar sculpture, and Jaume Plensa returned to Port Vauban, this time to anchor his lettered giant definitively. It was inaugurated in May 2010 in the presence of Frédéric Mitterand, Minister of Culture and Communication. [u'', u'Painted Steel'] art",

At a time when the American Bar Association and other national legal associations denied membership to African-American lawyers, these attorneys created their own legal organization. The project preserves local cultural history that has had great significance at the national and international levels.–––The National Bar Association is the nation’s oldest and largest national association of predominately African American lawyers and judges representing the United States, Africa, England, Canada, and the Virgin Islands. –– African American pioneer lawyers, dedicated to fight segregation and legal racism, started to gather between 1890 and 1900 and began the formation of the National  Bar Association. –– The ingenuity of these Midwestern lawyers changed the course of history.  The National Bar Association was founded at an Iowa Colored Bar Association convention held in Des Moines in 1924.  They incorporated one year later on August 1, 1925.\nThe five founders were Iowans.  George H. Woodson, S. Joe Brown, Gertrude E. Rush, James B. Morris, and Charles P. Howard, Sr.  The others, Wendell E. Green, C. Francis Stradford, Jesse N. Baker, William H. Haynes, and George C. Adams were from Chicago, and Charles H. Calloway, L. Amasa Knox from Kansas City. –– \n\nThe artist Kerry James Marshall’s prototype for the monument is representative of speaking drums. The monument will be two African drums sitting slightly off center, atop each other, with a base platform engraved with the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. A speakers’ platform will encourage the general public to “speak while standing on the First Amendment.”  In the current design, the sculpture will stand 37 feet by 20 feet on a plaza.

    "search_text" : "Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Civil War Monument  Des Moines  The State of Iowa erected this monument, funded partially by refunded war taxes, to commemorate Iowans who fought during the Civil War. The monument was approved in 1888, the cornerstone was laid in 1894, and the structure was completed two years later. Because a controversy developed over the location and artistic details of the monument, nearly 50 years passed before its dedication in 1945. \n\nIowa artist Harriet A. Ketcham's design for the memorial was chosen over 47 others, although she died before the monument was completed. Both real and symbolic figures are portrayed. “Victory“ is the most prominent figure, topping the 135-foot structure. Four equestrians -- all Iowa Civil War generals -- are depicted: Marcellus M. Crocker, who joined Grant at the siege of Vicksburg; Grenville M. Dodge, who built railroads to support Grant's army and accompanied Sherman on the “March to the Sea;“ Samuel R. Curtis, commander of the Union Army at Pea Ridge; and John M. Corse, who was promoted to brigadier general in 1863, and assigned to the command of the Fourth Division of the Fifteenth Army Corps. \n\nThe four soldiers depicted on the upper base represent Iowans who served in different branches of the military during the Civil War: Infantryman Shelby Norman, who, at the age of 18, was the first Iowan killed in battle; Ensign William H.C. Michael, a school teacher turned sailor; Artilleryman Captain Henry H. Griffiths, whose battery never lost a gun throughout the war; and Calvaryman Lt. James Horton, killed while leading a saber charge at the battle of Lovejoy Station. \n\nNearly 80,000 Civil War military men were from Iowa, the largest number of soldiers per capita of any state participating during the war. Noted Iowa generals and battle scenes are pictured along the base. On the north side, a statue portrays Iowa as a mother offering nourishment to her children. To the south, “History“ gazes into the future, and “Iowa“ is shown as a youngster. [u'', u'Bronze', u' Granite'] art",

The CAPS is clad in zinc and translucent glass to match the adjacent pavilion and is approximately the same size and shape. \n\nThe fabrication of Des Moines’ mural is scheduled to be completed in 2013.\n\nIn April 2012, the Greater Des Moines Public Art Foundation commissioned one of three design proposals for a glass mural by Jun Kaneko. To be illuminated from behind with LED lights, the mural will be located on the exterior wall of the triangular pump station and will face north towards the Hub Spot Plaza and pavilion  — the site of Kaneko’s signature “dango“ sculptures.\n\nThe mural will be a vivid and glowing construction of fused, tempered glass with overall dimensions of more than 15-feet high by 21-feet wide. The compositions emphasize rhythm, balance, and color.  A color palette of red, yellow, blue, white and black was selected.  A unique pattern of pictorial grids with hard-edge changing colors will be constructed through a system of horizontal stratum or bands. The mural design consists of seven narrow panels formed by horizontal bands.\n\nA translucent, fused glass screen has been designed, similar in detail to the translucent glass portion of the CAPS, to screen this equipment and secure it from the public. The intent of this project is to mask this large scale infrastructure from Riverwalk users and allow it to extend and work with – rather than against – the landscaping and architecture of the area.\n\nIn developing the building, substance Architecture [Des Moines] worked with planning consultants, engineers, and stakeholders to knit the building into the overall master plan for the area. In addition, substance has been involved in discussions with the Greater Des Moines Public Art Foundation who was interested in commissioning public artwork for the area. As part of these discussions, a glass artwork by internationally recognized artist Jun Kaneko is suggested on the north face of the CAPS to accompany a series of large scale ceramic pieces that planned for the Hub Spot. This artwork was commissioned for the building to unite the two spaces and enhance the intersection. \n\nThe integration of artwork into this area is consistent with the growing list of other public works along the Riverwalk such as Joel Shapiro at City Hall, and Sally Pettus at Hansen Triangle.

However, it was in Omaha, Nebraska, where he permanently located in 1987, that he created his first Dangos.

Each glazed surface was painted with bold and geometric patterns in black, white and red.  \n\nThe dangos’ unique form, as well as their expressive patterns and shapes, was carefully selected to be integrated into the infrastructure of the plaza.

    "search_text" : "Three Cairns  Des Moines  “Three Cairns“ is the largest project in the Western Hemisphere by British artist Andy Goldsworthy. Cairns are stone structures [or markers] that identify a place of great importance. Their dry-stone construction represents an engineering feat as well as artistic creativity. The process of shaping and stacking the stones into a simple oval shape is challenging and intense. The form symbolizes fullness and ripeness, time and energy, loss and endurance.\n\nGoldsworthy relays this concept in the “Three Cairns“ project that was constructed in the United States from 2001 to 2002. The Midwest, and its association with the two coasts, fascinated Goldsworthy. He pictured an imaginary line that branched out from the Midwest and cut across the entire continent. At each point, West coast, East coast, and Midwest, he built an Iowa limestone cairn that marked a certain place of significance. Goldsworthy chose to structure cairns for what they have always represented. \n\nGoldsworthy first began constructing the East Coast Cairn on November 2, 2001. It was built outside of the Neuberger Museum of Art in New York, where neither Goldsworthy nor his assistants were ready for the experience or allegorical influence of the “Three Cairns.“ Life, death, and regeneration, the underlying principles of Goldsworthy’s art, took on profound and unexpected new meaning with the unimaginable events of September 11, 2001. The West Coast Cairn was constructed outside of the San Diego Museum of Contemporary Art in La Jolla, California. The limestone’s history, though from Iowa, dates back so far that it sustains fossilized remains of oceanic creatures. This connection of life through time intrigued Goldsworthy, especially since the rock was originally excavated in the Midwest, very far from the oceanic scene of California. Lastly, the Midwest Cairn was built in Greenwood Park behind the Des Moines Art Center in 2002. The sculpture, being the center of the continent-wide piece, consists of three massive block-like walls positioned to the east, west and south of the middle cairn.\n\nThe project was initiated by the Des Moines Art Center and organized in collaboration with the Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego and the Neuberger Museum of Art, Purchase, New York.

Rising eleven feet and higher, wearing business suits and ties and nondescript dresses, they have a spookily imposing physical presence and a clunky, cartoonish ugliness.\n\nRoughly glazed in strident colors and made in sections that fit together like blocks in a stone wall, they could be mistaken for a species of Outsider art. Because of their size and their blank or seemingly angry expressions, they may remind you of what it was like to be a child among grown-ups troubled by incomprehensible problems.\n\nBesides the striking scale, a big part of the attraction of the man in the incandescent suit is the painterly treatment of his surfaces. With a brushy, Fauvist approach, Frey gave his garments slashing white and orange highlights and added purple shadows to his yellow face. He is as much a three-dimensional painting as a conventional statue.\n\nFrey was influenced by the Bay Area figurative paintings of artists like Richard Diebenkorn and Elmer Bischoff as well as by the bold, cartoonish paintings of Joan Brown.

Special recognition to Don Scandrett for stained glass fabrication. Additional services were provided by Travis Rice, with metal work by Jim Dawson, Ken Hyde and Josh Crook of Iowa Metal Fabrication. Interior signage fabrication assistance by James Mulvihill of Mulvihill Art Works.\n\nThe commissioned project visualizes the Iowa Department of Public Safety which is dedicated to protect and serve the public. And, as a tangible expression of that vision, the project is a tribute to the professionals who have impacted individuals and communities.  Their “imprint” on Iowa is implicit in this commission and deemed as unique as the landscape of Iowa itself.\n\n“Hand and Land: Fingerprint,“ a site-integrated work of art, consists of numerous elements: two exterior illuminated pattern-cut steel columns; a series of terracotta tiles flanking the main entrance; a large stained glass window and illuminated metal cut text in the interior lobby; and colored wood relief signage on each floor.\n\nOutside the main building entrance, two free-standing exterior columns are focal points below a prominent arch-shaped canopy. The columns introduce the concept of “hand” and “land” in a dynamic physical way by marking the entrance. Crowning each column is a phrase cut into the steel capitals: “Our Hands Our Lands.”  On the cement base of the columns are terracotta markers with the words “Public” and “Safety.”  The columns function as outdoor lights. The main feature of each column is its black, steel-cut sleeve displaying an enormously magnified fingerprint pattern. The illuminated columns become ambient features of the site as daylight fades to night-time.\n\nThe message is reinforced with terracotta hands and symbols relating to each division within the Department of Public Safety. Arranged into vertical compositions, they are embedded within the brickwork and border the entrance doors. The terracotta’s natural, brownish-orange color blends seamlessly with exterior brickwork.  Hand gestures, a form of body language, continue the public safety theme. Examples include an open hand (helping hand) and handshake (gesture of peace;) in addition, emblematic objects such as an armored or bullet-proof vest, blazing fire, a left boot-print, and a State Patrol hat are modeled in low-relief terracotta blocks.\n\nThe exterior columns, as well as the interior stained glass wall, have recognizable fingerprint patterns. These patterns evoke fingerprint identification which is gathered by experts during investigations by the different divisions within the Department of Public Safety.\n\nAs well, the “fingerprint“ image echoes the Iowa landscape—contour lines call to mind detailed sections of topographical maps. Fingerprints are suggestive of the layout of Iowa fields, and appear to transform into plot designs of crop row-orientation.\n\nOnce visitors pass through the front entrance and are inside the main lobby, attention is drawn to a large wall of “stained glass.” The blue-colored stained glass and overall abstracted design evoke landscape and water. The expanse of white, blue and black colored glass forms a bold pattern of undulating lines that spiral into a core – called a “whorl pattern” in fingerprint classification.\n\nLooking up towards the lobby’s bulkhead is a quotation cut from black metal in Jason-italic font. The text and diffused backlights border the atrium on three sides; the quotation reads: “I have been where you fear to be; I have seen what you fear to see; I have done what you fear to do; All these things I have done for you.”  It is the first of four stanzas in a poem that officers, paramedics and other public safety workers often carry in their vehicles. This unknown author’s poem has become a “talisman“ or precept guiding actions, as well as a testimony to the risk and importance of this department.\n [u'Architectural Sculpture', u'Glass', u' Steel', u' Wood'] art",

For the artist, whose work has explored themes of childhood memory and loss, the spider carries associations of a maternal figure. Indeed, Bourgeois' “Spider“ series relates to her own mother who died when the artist was twenty-one. From drawings to large-scale installations, Bourgeois' spiders appear as looming and powerful protectresses, yet are nurturing, delicate, and vulnerable.  [u'', u'Bronze'] art",

    "search_text" : "Cosmic Seed  Des Moines  Cosmic Seed is a seminal work of art by Ronald Bladen. Its tensile energy is extract from the connections between perfect planes, elegant form, and careful consideration of the void spaces. An outdoor, monumental sculpture, Cosmic Seed captures, through abstract means, the sublime impression of organic growth.\n\nThe elegant U-shaped surface belies its concealed interior – an ornate construction system of beams, braces, struts, and other structural devices – and suggests an affinity between plant seed coats and their internal structures.\n\nAs Cosmic Seed was being installed in 1980, Des Moines Register art critic Nick Baldwin described the steel skin of the sculpture: “The semi-gloss black paint on the exterior sides of the U stand in dramatic juxtaposition to the (polished) stainless steel surface on the U’s inside.”  Baldwin observed that artist’s objective “was to create a [sculpture] that would gain in clarity and impact through the use of uncluttered wall as a backdrop.” Baldwin also wrote about its precise, geometric form which “harmonizes well with the clean lines of the building.”  [Baldwin, Nick. “Sculpture is approved for Wallace Building,” Des Moines Sunday Register, November 6, 1977, p. 12A.]\n\nSince its installation in 1980 at the entrance of the Henry Wallace Building, Cosmic Seed ‘s massive countenance has characterized the central importance of the farmer, the local community and its governing institutions. The Wallace Building maintains offices for the regulation of agricultural marketing and commodities. The building is named after Iowan Henry A. Wallace, Vice President of the United States (1941–45) and the Secretary of Agriculture (1933–1940). [u'Sculpture', u'Steel'] art",

The bicycle art racks are in eight separate locations east of the Des Moines River, along East Locust Street and East Grand Avenue.\n\nThe submissions were reviewed by an experienced panel of judges \nwho made final recommendations based on pre-determined criteria and quality \nof the artist's work.  As a result, Iowa artists were commissioned to create \nthese bike rack sculptures for installation throughout the historic East Village.\n\n   The sculptures were unveiled during “Bike to Work Week,“ which took place during spring 2006.  The Greater Des Moines Public Art Foundation was pleased to assist the Historic East Village, Inc. by helping to select the artists and provide one-half of the $2,000 stipends paid to each commissioned artist. “Spotted Dog“ by Matthew N.

    "search_text" : "High Trestle Trail Bridge  Woodward  The High Trestle Bridge stands 13 stories high and spans ½ mile across the Des Moines River between Madrid and Woodward. The “portals“ or vertical elements that form a gateway to the Des Moines River Bridge are sculptural symbols that speak to this geology, the cutting and slicing of nature that forms this river valley. Seen from a distance, they become a destination “icon“ that bracket the experience of crossing the river on this expansive trail bridge. Scale is one of the most important elements to the integration of these sculptural features. They must relate in size not only to the length of the span, over 2,300 feet across the river, hut also the height above the river valley, represented by massive columns, some nearly 130 feet tall. These icons visually “focus“ the trail and set up the concept of entering a mine. Seams of coal appear in lighted veins in the stacked forms on the bridge landings. One is inside the story, surrounded by the sculptural forms that embody history and geology. The changing geometry of the steel cribbing radiates around you. The viewer moves along the path as though moving through history, through the tunnel of a mine. Blue LED fixtures highlight the inside faces of each crib.\n\nThe “High Trestle Trail Bridge is 35 feet tall x 12 feet wide x 2640 feet long.\n\n\nAWARDS: \nIowa\/ Minnesota Illuminating Engineering Society - Regional Lighting Section Award - 2012;\n\nAIA Iowa Chapter - Merit Excellence in Design Award - 2011;\n\nIlluminating Engineering Society of North America - National Lighting - Award of Merit - 2012;\n\nPublic Art Network - “Year in Review“ Listing of Top 50 Art Projects - 2012; and \n\nArchitectural SSL Magazine - Product Innovation Award - 2012.\n [u'Installation', u'LED Lights', u' Steel'] art",
